## 📽️ The Experience
**Turtle Draw** isn't just a simple script; it's a demonstration of **State-Driven GUI Logic**. 
It features a high-fidelity loading sequence designed to give the user a "AAA Games" feel right in the Python console.

## 🛠️ Key Engine Features

### ⏳ Phase 1: The Boot Sequence
* **Vector Rendering:** Custom-drawn rectangle outlines for the UI.
* **Stamping Logic:** High-speed shape stamping to create a flicker-free, solid loading bar.
* **Async Logic:** Real-time percentage tracking that updates without interrupting the animation.

### 🎨 Phase 2: The Creative Canvas
* **Instant Transition:** Switches from Dark Mode (Loading) to Light Mode (Play) with a single keystroke.
* **State Control:** Re-enables the rendering engine (`tracer(1)`) only when the game starts to maximize performance.
